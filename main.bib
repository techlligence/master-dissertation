abstract = {The overall structure of this new edition is three-tier: Part I presents the basics, Part II is concerned with methodological issues, and Part III discusses advanced topics. In the second edition the authors have reorganized the material to focus on problems, how to represent them, and then how to choose and design algorithms for different representations. They also added a chapter on problems, reflecting the overall book focus on problem-solvers, a chapter on parameter tuning, which they combined with the parameter control and "how-to" chapters into a methodological part, and finally a chapter on evolutionary robotics with an outlook on possible exciting developments in this field. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence and computational intelligence, and for self-study by practitioners and researchers engaged with all aspects of bioinspired design and optimization.}

abstract = {This book introduces readers to the fundamentals of artificial neural networks, with a special emphasis on evolutionary algorithms. At first, the book offers a literature review of several well-regarded evolutionary algorithms, including particle swarm and ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms and biogeography-based optimization. It then proposes evolutionary version of several types of neural networks such as feed forward neural networks, radial basis function networks, as well as recurrent neural networks and multi-later perceptron. Most of the challenges that have to be addressed when training artificial neural networks using evolutionary algorithms are discussed in detail. The book also demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithms for several purposes such as classification, clustering, approximation, and prediction problems. It provides a tutorial on how to design, adapt, and evaluate artificial neural networks as well, and includes source codes for most of the proposed techniques as supplementary materials.}

abstract = {The population initialization step is a common step in the majority (or even all) of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). There are many population initialization techniques. Due to the limited population size and the high dimensionality of many problems, there is little chance to cover the promising regions in the search space. From different perspectives, this paper compares the stochastic and deterministic population initialization techniques through comparing five of the well-known population initializers: Random number generator (RNG), Latin Hypercube, Sobol, Halton, and Kronecker. Due to the presence of many constraints in real-world applications, in this paper, we are focusing only on single-objective constrained optimization problems. Specifically, the goal is to investigate if there is a significant difference between these population initialization methods. In this paper, we explain theoretically and mathematically these different population initialization techniques. Moreover, different illustrative examples and visualizations are introduced to explain the behavior of each technique and compare different techniques from different perspectives. The results show that due to the high uniformity of the low-discrepancy sequences such as the Halton and Sobol sequences, the generated points using these sequences are more evenly distributed over the space than RNG, which is the commonly used technique for initializing the populations in EAs. Practically, using a set of benchmark functions, we investigate the use of each population initialization technique for initializing different population-based evolutionary algorithms. The results of our experiments prove that with sufficient numbers of iterations, the EAs are not sensitive to the initialization methods and there are no significant differences between the mentioned population initialization methods. Further, the low discrepancy methods enhance the exploration ability of EAs in early iterations.}

By evolving a population of solutions, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are able to approximate the Pareto optimal set in a single run. MOEAs have attracted a lot of research effort during the last 20 years, and they are still one of the hottest research areas in the field of evolutionary computation. This paper surveys the development of MOEAs primarily during the last eight years. It covers algorithmic frameworks such as decomposition-based MOEAs (MOEA/Ds), memetic MOEAs, coevolutionary MOEAs, selection and offspring reproduction operators, MOEAs with specific search methods, MOEAs for multimodal problems, constraint handling and MOEAs, computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), dynamic MOPs, noisy MOPs, combinatorial and discrete MOPs, benchmark problems, performance indicators, and applications. In addition, some future research issues are also presented.}

title = {Maintaining population diversity in evolutionary algorithms via epigenetics and speciation},
abstract = {When working with evolutionary algorithms, a balance between exploration andexploitation has to be maintained. The main driver of exploration is the reproductionoperation, which is dependent on population diversity to enable effective exploration.The lack of population diversity can thus become a problem if explorationis required during the later stages of the algorithm. One example where thisis relevant is when working with dynamic environments. If a change occurs in theenvironment, the algorithm might require some exploration to adapt to the change.This research aims to demonstrate that if an algorithm is able to maintain populationdiversity during the latter of its execution, it will be able to adapt to changes moreeffectively. This research produced a set of novel algorithms to explore differentmethods of maintaining population diversity. The first group of developed algorithmsdraws inspiration from gene methylation by adding non-coding genes to thechromosome. The non-coding genes can then act as a reservoir of genetic diversityafter the algorithm converges and the diversity in the expressed genes diminishes.The second algorithm implemented parapatric speciation in an evolutionary algorithm.The algorithm attempts to divide the population into separate species, whichthen populate different areas of the search space. Testing of the developed algorithmshowed that it is possible to maintain more diversity in the latter generations of thealgorithm. The developed algorithms were also able to adapt more effectively tochange in the environment, indicating that the algorithms were able to use the increaseddiversity when required. Finally, the research showed that the maintainingof diversity is not the only option for allowing exploration in the latter stages of analgorithm. Algorithms that are less effective at maintaining diversity, but are able torapidly produce diversity when required are also able to shift focus to explorationwhen adapting to change in the environment.},

abstract="Gene Expression Programming(GEP) is a kind of heuristic method based on evolutionary computation theory. Basic GEP method has been proved to be powerful in symbolic regression and data mining tasks. However, GEP's potential for neural network learning has not been well studied. In this paper, we prove that basic GEP neural network(GEPNN) is unable to solve difficult regression and classification problems. Based on our proof, we propose an extended method for evolving neural network with GEP. The extended GEPNN is used in function finding and classification problems. Results on multiple learning methods show the effectiveness of our method.",

abstract = {Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a popular heuristic method for dealing complex problems with very large search space. Among various phases of GA, the initial phase of population seeding plays an important role in deciding the span of GA to achieve the best fit w.r.t. the time. In other words, the quality of individual solutions generated in the initial population phase plays a critical role in determining the quality of final optimal solution. The traditional GA with random population seeding technique is quite simple and of course efficient to some extent; however, the population may contain poor quality individuals which take long time to converge with optimal solution. On the other hand, the hybrid population seeding techniques which have the benefit of good quality individuals and fast convergence lacks in terms of randomness, individual diversity and ability to converge with global optimal solution. This motivates to design a population seeding technique with multifaceted features of randomness, individual diversity and good quality. In this paper, an efficient Ordered Distance Vector (ODV) based population seeding technique has been proposed for permutation-coded GA using an elitist service transfer approach. One of the famous combinatorial hard problems of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is being chosen as the testbed and the experiments are performed on different sized benchmark TSP instances obtained from standard TSPLIB [54]. The experimental results advocate that the proposed technique outperforms the existing popular initialization methods in terms of convergence rate, error rate and convergence time.}

abstract="The first part of this chapter describes the foundation of genetic algorithms. It includes hybrid genetic algorithms, adaptive genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic controllers. After a short introduction to genetic algorithms, the second part describes combinatorial optimization problems including the knapsack problem, the minimum spanning tree problem, the set-covering problem, the bin-packing problem, and the traveling-salesman problem; these are combinatorial optimization problems which are characterized by a finite number of feasible solutions. The third part describes network design problems. Network design and routing are important issues in the building and expansion of computer networks. In this part, the shortest-path problem, maximum-flow problem, minimum-cost-flow problem, centralized network design, and multistage process planning problem are introduced. These problems are typical network problems and have been studied for a long time. The fourth section describes scheduling problems. Many scheduling problems from manufacturing industries are quite complex in nature and very difficult to solve by conventional optimization techniques. In this part the flow-shop sequencing problem, job-shop scheduling, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem, and multiprocessor scheduling are introduced. The fifth part introduces the reliability design problem, including simple genetic algorithms for reliability optimization, reliability design with redundant units and alternatives, network reliability design, and tree-based network topology design. The sixth part describes logistic problems including the linear transportation problem, the multiobjective transportation problem, the bicriteria transportation problem with fuzzy coefficients, and supply chain management network design. Finally, the last part describes location and allocation problems including the location-allocation problem, capacitated plant-location problem, and obstacle location-allocation problem.",
